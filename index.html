                    A fully featured 2D game engine written in C++ with game state and asset management, physics simulation, and various animation
                    features. It is very early in development, but already features game state management and some collision
                    detection capabilities.

                <h2>I Wanna Conquer the Chaos Cave</h2>
                <p>
                    A precision platformer in the subgenre known as I Wanna Be the Guy fangames. Based heavily on the mechanics of I Wanna Be
                    the Guy, the game contains difficult spike-dodging platforming and a chaotic avoidance boss fight. My
                    core design challenge was to create a boss that has randomness in every attack yet is always possible
                    and fair, unlike most bosses in the genre. Made in GameMaker: Studio.

                <h2>Prototypes</h2>
                <h3>Grappledash</h3>
                <p>
                    Grappledash is a grappling hook -based 3D platformer made in Unity. It is on an indefinite hiatus in favor of MoleEngine
                    development for now, but playing around with the prototype is exteremely fun and I plan to explore the
                    idea further.

                <h2>Game Design Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                    In the summer of 2017 I participated in a game jam -style university course where I created the following two game prototypes
                    with a four-man team.

                <h3>No Man's Canvas</h3>
                <p>
                    No Man's Canvas is a clone of Reddit's r/Place. It's a sandbox where players use a limited number of pixels to draw on a
                    shared canvas in real time. Pixels refresh with time, and drawing more increases the number of pixels
                    you can hold at a time. I worked on the ReactJS-based front-end. The back-end is written in Swift and
                    runs on my friend's personal server.

                <h3>The Division of Sweden</h3>
                <p>
                    The Division of Sweden is a virtual reality passport inpection game inspired by Papers, Please. You play as a border agent
                    on the volatile border of East Sweden and West Sweden, tasked with keeping illegitimate immigrants on
                    their side of the border. You must make sure all the information matches on all of the travellers' documents.
                    The game was made in Unity and requires an Oculus Rift VR headset and a Leap Motion hand sensor to play.

                <p>
                    I never actually made anything with this because I began my military service before I managed to get everything I needed
                    working, but this was my first attempt at creating complex interactions between game objects. It featured
                    collision detection between arbitrary convex polygons, circles and line segments, optimized with a simple
                    grid-based spatial partitioning system, and basic (buggy) physics simulation on collisions. It also had
                    the beginnings of an AI movement system, but all of this ended up very unfinished.

                <h2>Minecraft: Ocean Adventures Mod</h2>
                <p>
                    My most popular release to date with over 20,000 downloads, the Ocean Adventures mod for Minecraft started in 2012 as an
                    effort to tweak the Minecraft world generator to create more interesting oceans. Through adjusting the
                    game's existing biome system it generates a world entirely covered in an ocean and dotted with various
                    types of islands. The mod grew over time to also add a variety of items and entities, such as a speedboat
                    for quickly traversing the ocean, a new farmable crop and an ore that only appears on the seafloor. Development
                    has been discontinued so the mod is not compatible with the latest versions of Minecraft.

                    I learned about programming and game development in 2009, at the age of 13. For the first few years I only made a few tiny
                    and wholly unremarkable Flash games, but I already knew programming was something I wanted to do a lot
                    more in the future.
